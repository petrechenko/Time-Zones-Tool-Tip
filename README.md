# Time-Zones-Tool-Tip
My first project working at SeedCode for DayBack add on Calendar. This tooltip will translate your appointments into three other time zones. Also, itâ€™s easy to customize so you can add more cities if you need to. This is also a great example of how fun it can be to use JavaScript within FileMaker because JS makes these kinds of timezone transformations much easier.
